Introduction
This image classification model is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a popular architecture for image-related tasks. It classifies two categories of images: "birds" (bald eagle) and "hares." The project demonstrates the process from data extraction to model evaluation, including accuracy and loss evaluation.

The model is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras, and it is trained on images resized to 128x128 pixels. The results of the model’s performance on the test data are shown below.

Dataset
The dataset used for training the model consists of images from two categories:

Birds (Bald Eagles) - Folder: /content/data(CNN)/bird bald_eagle
Hares - Folder: /content/data(CNN)/hare
Each folder contains a set of images, and these images are labeled accordingly:

0 for hare
1 for bald eagle
